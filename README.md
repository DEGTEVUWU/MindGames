Hello everyone!  
This is my first project on GitHub during my Hexlet training.

# **Brain game!** #

The project consists of 5 mathematical games and is launched in the console. The menu will be displayed first
further, the player will be offered a choice, depending on the entered number, one of 5 (so far 😏 😮) games will be displayed. The player will have to answer all questions correctly (usually there are three) to win. If the player makes a mistake, the game will notify him and will be over. Try again to win!

Good luck!

To run, use:

```
make run-dist
```
